<h1 align=center>Crowd Counting Project</h1>

This project is about developing a deep learning model that is capable of counting people from an image.

For our project, we are going to use the [Mall dataset](https://personal.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~ccloy/downloads_mall_dataset.html), which contains 2000 frames from a CCTV footage with over 60,000 pedestrians. The data has annotations with the count of people on the frame and their head locations.
